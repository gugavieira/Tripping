		<h2>Tripping is not a travel photography blog.<br>Not only.</h2>
	</div>
	<p>It's a place to organize and share experiences. Most of them are related to travel, but hopefully you'll also find some interesting experiments as I develop my photography skills along the way.</p>
	<p> I know I could have used something like Facebook, but I'm not that good at shooting food or cats. Maybe Flickr. But honestly, I'm not a big fan of their layout. And besides that I'd have missed out on the opportunity to try putting a whole website together by myself.</p>
